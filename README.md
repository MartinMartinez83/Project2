# Project 2 QuaranSale

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-JavaScript-brightgreen)

## Description
This project creates a website called QuaranSalw where sellers can create a page for their personal online garage sale.  Buyers will be able to access the sales both from an individual seller's link to their sale page, or from a list of all sales on the Buyers page of the QuaranSale website. The website will have the following pages:

* Front page - Title page with links to pages for Buyer and Seller
* Buyer page - List of available sales with a link to each sale page
* Seller Login page - Enables sellers to create an account and log into the website
* Seller page - Form where the seller enters their personal information and the information about the items they want list for sale
* Sale pages - Pages created each time a seller completes the form on the seller page and displays items for sale
* About Us/Articles page - under construction
